With a unique blend of expertise in chemical engineering and software engineering, I bring a diverse set of technical and management skills to the IT industry. My journey has taken me to the heart of Cloud computing and DevOps at Novobanco, where my focus is on optimizing operational efficiency and maximizing client value through the adoption of industry best practices.

My role involves extensive work in project management, strategic planning, and problem-solving, where I consistently seek innovative solutions to complex challenges. I am passionate about professional development, always eager to learn and excel in dynamic, team-oriented settings.

My vision is encapsulated in one phrase: "Generating Value." I am a strong advocate for developing intelligent processes, believing that they are crucial for building a better, more efficient society.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- Apache Airflow
- OpenShift
- CheckMK
- Linux
- Docker
- GitHub
